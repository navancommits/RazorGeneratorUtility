# RazorGeneratorUtility
Updates cshtml props with razorgenerator settings
Although 0.1 release is compatible with RazorGenerator.Mvc, didn't want the .generated.cs files auto-generated files
So, in case of 0.2 release, have the provision to migrate from RazorGenerator.Mvc to RazorGenerator.MsBuild nuget package and the associatec cleanup process
Could save someone their time since I didn't know initially that RazorGenerator.MsBuild is cleaner....
